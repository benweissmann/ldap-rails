You're all set up for authentication. Just double-check that the settings
in config/initializers/ldap_auth.rb are correct.

YOu can style the login page with CSS, or just use Bootstrap
(http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) -- the login page is set up to
loog great with Bootstrap.

In your controllers, use "ldap_user.username" to get the username of the
logged in user. In your views, use "@controller.ldap_user.username".

To create a simple login status display with a logout link
(e.g. "You are logged in as someuser. <a href="/logout">Log Out</a>.")
use:

<%= ldap_status %>

To log out a user, submit a POST request to "/logout_ldap". You can
create a logout link in your views with:

<%= link_to 'Log Out', ldap_logout_path, :method => :post %>
